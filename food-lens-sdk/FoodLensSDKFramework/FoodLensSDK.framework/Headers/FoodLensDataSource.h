    Protocol declaring mutable dataSource methods for storing or deleting updated or new data.
    
    Actually no one of FoodLens UI requires mutable dataSource. But online dataSource instances returned from @c -[FoodLens instantiateOnlineHistoryDataSource] conforms to the mutable protocol. So FoodLens delegate implementation can just put or delete data right to the online data source.
    
    @code
    func foodLensPut(_ foodLens: FoodLens, foodCheckIn: FoodLensFoodCheckIn, from viewController: UIViewController?) {
        (foodLens.dataSource as? FoodLensMutableDataSource)?.foodLensPut(foodLens, checkIn: foodCheckIn)
