/**
    The entry point of FoodLens SDK.

    Initialize FoodLens for the first time using @c +authorizedInstanceWithAccessToken:.
    Next time access the last authorized instance with @c+lastAuthorizedInstance.
    @c +lastAuthorizedInstance cleans up the last stored instance.

    FoodLens interface is divided onto two parts. UI and low level UI less.
    
    @c -instatiateViewController methods are intended to instatiate the UI part.
    View Controllers take required data from dataSource and return new or updated data to delegate.
    It's a user responsibility to store the data back.

    FoodLens gives convenient way to manage and store data online.
    @c -instantiateOnlineHistoryDataSource instantiates data source which loads online data.
    It also conform to @c FoodLensMutableDataSource protocol. So it's possible to store the data returned to delegate online.

    @c -recognizeFood:withCompletion: is a UI less method for recognizing food on the given image.
